                            - MySQL is an online database used worldwide around the globe. This can be used for simple
                            tasks such as creating a shopping list to managing diffent levels of users depending on
                            query handlers. Having a relational database we are able to create "links" between tables by
                            using primary keys and foriegn keys. These keys are what is used to make the connections
                            possible.
                        </p><br></br>
                        <p>
                            - Having an unsecured database system can create a realm of vulnerabilities in a company’s
                            security measures. With one successful injection, a user can break in and gain access to so
                            much more behind the initial checkpoint especially if there isn't further validation. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                            - Remember these types of attacks use SQL statements to gain access, the easiest way to
                            prevent these kinds of attacks are to set up properly sanitized database permissions such as
                            validation and session tokens that expire after a set amount of time.
                        </p><br></br>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="subTitle centerIt space2" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">What are SQL queries:</h2>
                <p> SQL is a standardized language used to maintain and manipulate databases to create a custom query
                    specific to what a user needs. These queries are used to execute commands such as data retrieval,
                    data removal and updating what’s currently in the database. Different SQL elements implement these
                    tasks, such as SELECT, WHERE, RETURN, and MATCHING. We can further filter the data with conditional
                    statements or keywords if the results are to broad. </p>
            </div>

            <br></br>
            <!-- code snippet section -->
            <div class="container text-center">
                <p>This is what a typical query may look like. In this example we get the items <span
                        class="boldly">name</span> and <span class="boldly">description</span> from the <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">table:</span> <span class="boldly">Item</span>. </p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        WHERE ItemNumber = ItemNumber
                    </code>
                 </pre>
                <br></br>
                <p>Looks promising right? Well from here, the web application builds a string query that is then sent to
                    the database to retrieve your data.</p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        //Converted query for SQL to read
                        sql_query= "
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        WHERE ItemNumber = " & Request.QueryString("ItemID")
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br>
                <p>But you ask yourself how do we know which item we are referring to? Well this is where we can ask the
                    user for input or have pre-made guided solutions to this problem as to not have a user return
                    something they shouldn't have access to. We then make sure to match the item number given to the one
                    already in the database.
                    The final step is taking the provided users input such as itemid=999 to generate the final query.
                </p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        //users input
                        WHERE ItemNumber = 999
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br>
                <p>As you probably guessed already it will return the data on the specific item only in this example and
                    nothing else. </p><br></br>
                <table class="table table-striped" style="background-color: whitesmoke;">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="col">Item #</th>
                            <th scope="col">Name</th>
                            <th scope="col">Description</th>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="row">999</th>
                            <td>Tomato Sauce</td>
                            <td>You really need a description on tomato sauce? Really? it's just SAUCE in a CAN.</td>

                        </tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table><br></br>
                <p>One thing to note is that we need to make sure each item in a table has a unique identifier so that
                    we can reference it later. This also should not be editable as changing this identifier can cause
                    issues down the line. Instead if we wanted to update or delete an item we can edit the other
                    contents of a specific item in the table.</p><br></br>

                                        its straightforward and effective nature, stands out as one of the prevalent
                                        forms of SQL injection attacks. This method can further be categorized into two
                                        sub-variations: </p>

                                    <p>The malicious actor transmits data payloads to the server and scrutinizes the
                                        server's response and behavior to gain insights into its structure. This
                                        technique is referred to as blind SQL injection since the information isn't
                                        directly relayed from
                                        the website database to the attacker. Consequently, the attacker remains unaware
                                        of the attack details in an in-band fashion. Blind SQL injections rely on the
                                        response and behavioral patterns of the server, making them typically slower to
                                        execute but potentially just as harmful. Blind SQL injections can be classified
                                        as follows:</p>

                                        the database server employed by the web application. Out-of-band SQL injection
                                        primarily serves as an alternative to the in-band and inferential SQL injection
                                        techniques.

                                        Out-of-band SQL injection is executed in situations where the attacker cannot
                                        employ the same communication channel for both launching the attack and
                                        retrieving information. This is especially relevant when a server's performance
                                        is inadequate or unstable for conducting these actions simultaneously. These
                                        techniques rely on the server's capability to initiate DNS or HTTP requests for
                                        transmitting data to the attacker.</p>

                    <p>There exist several effective methods for both preventing SQL injection (SQLI) attacks and
                        safeguarding against them in case of occurrence.

                        The initial step involves input validation, also known as sanitization. This practice entails
                        crafting code capable of recognizing unauthorized user inputs.

                        While input validation is a recommended best practice, it is not always a foolproof solution. In
                        most cases, it's impractical to enumerate all legal and illegal inputs without generating
                        numerous false positives, which can disrupt user experience and an application's functionality.

                    </p> <br></br>
                    <p> For this reason, <span class="boldly">web application firewalls (WAFs)</span> are frequently
                        employed to filter out SQL injection attacks and other online threats. WAFs rely on an extensive
                        and constantly updated list of meticulously designed signatures to surgically identify and block
                        malicious SQL queries. Typically, this list includes signatures for specific attack vectors and
                        is regularly updated to introduce blocking rules for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

                        Modern web application firewalls are often integrated with other security solutions. These
                        integrations provide additional information to enhance their security capabilities.

                        For instance, when a web application firewall encounters a suspicious but not overtly malicious
                        input, it may cross-verify the input with IP data before deciding to block the request. It will
                        only block the input if the IP address itself has a history of bad reputation.

                    </p><br></br>
                    <p> Imperva's cloud-based WAF employs signature recognition, IP reputation, and other security
                        techniques to detect and block SQL injections while minimizing false positives. The WAF's
                        capabilities are further strengthened by IncapRules, a custom security rule engine that allows
                        for fine-tuning default security settings and the creation of specific security policies.</p>

            <!-- SQL Attack example -->
            <h3 class="underlined Title"  style="padding-top: 15rem" id="Examples">SQL Injection Examples</h3>
            <div class="container text-center">
                <p>To carry out SQL injection, an attacker seeks to manipulate a typical SQL query to exploit
                    vulnerabilities in a database where input validation is lacking. Numerous techniques exist to
                    execute this attack vector, and here are a few examples to illustrate how SQL injection functions.

                </p><br></br>
                <p>For instance, the mentioned input designed to retrieve information for a particular product can be
                    modified to appear as follows: http://www.estore.com/items/items.asp?itemid=999 <span class="boldly">or 1=1</span>.

                </p><br></br>
                <p>Consequently, the SQL query associated with this input is transformed to:</p><br></br>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Items
                        //validation of the OR statement returns true if one of the statements is true
                        WHERE ItemNumber = 999 OR 1=1
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br>
                <p>Given that the condition "1 = 1" is perpetually true, the query retrieves all product names and
                    descriptions from the database, including those that might otherwise be restricted from your access.
                </p><br></br>
                <p>Another injection, attackers can exploit improperly filtered characters to manipulate SQL commands, including the use of
                    a semicolon to separate two fields.</p><br></br>
                  <p>For instance, with input like this: http://www.estore.com/items/iteams.asp?itemid=999<span class="boldly">; DROP TABLE USERS</span>, the resulting SQL query would be:</p><br></br>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Items
                        //deletes table USERS connected to Items table
                        WHERE ItemNumber = 999; DROP TABLE USERS
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br> 
                 <p>The final result, deleting the USERS table completely.</p> <br></br>
                 <p>An alternative method for manipulating SQL queries involves using a UNION SELECT statement. This statement merges two distinct SELECT queries to extract data from various database tables.</p>
                 <br></br><p>For our final example, the input http://www.estore.com/items/items.asp?itemid=999 UNION SELECT user-name, password FROM USERS produces the following SQL query:</p><br></br>
                 <pre>
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Items
                        WHERE ItemID = '999' UNION SELECT Username, Password FROM Users;
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br> 
                 <p style="padding-bottom: 8rem;">By employing the UNION SELECT statement, this query unites the request for the name and description of item 999 with another request that retrieves names and passwords for all users in the database.</p>

                            - Cross-site scripting, better known as XSS is an attack in which an attacker injects
                            malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted source. Typically, this code can run
                            without the need of server-side rendering.
                        </p><br></br>
                        <p>
                            - With tons of efforts spent on its mitigation, Cross-site scripting (XSS) remains one of
                            the most prevalent security threats on the internet.
                        </p><br></br>
                        <p>
                            - Decades of research on the topic has demonstrated that code inspection and testing alone
                            does not eliminate XSS vulnerabilities in complex web applications with a high degree of
                            success.

            <h2 class="subTitle centerIt space2">Known XSS Attacks:</h2>
            <p class="card-body " style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-left:10rem; margin-right: 10rem;">Cross-site scripting
                attacks are a type of injection with malicious scripts placed into trusted sites. For this to occur
                generally, the attacker will send browser side script code to a different end user which in turn the
                unsuspecting user's browser has no way to know if this is a trusted source or not and executes it
                anyways. With this in mind, there have been enough attacks done to create different categories (although
                not all can be classified since there is always an ongoing effort to combat these attacks and can change
                overtime) these are just a few of the known types:
            </p><br></br>
            <p>XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected and stored</p>
            <div class="centerDiv centerIt row ">
                <div class="col card width-80">
                    <div class="card-header ">
                        <h3> Reflected:</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2rem;">Reflected attacks are attacks where injected script is reflected off
                        the web server. These attacks are delivered to a victim through routes such as emails or
                        interaction with another malicious site:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2rem;">Stored attacks are those that have the injected script permanently
                        stored on the targets servers such as in databases, forums, comments, ect.</p>

            </div>
            <p style="padding-top: 3rem;">There is one more lesser known attack, known as DOM-based XSS</p>

                        <div class="card-header" style="margin-bottom: 3rem; margin-top: 3rem;">
                            <p>Document Object Model (DOM) based attacks are those that enables attackers to inject
                                malicious payload into a webpage that in turn manipulates the client sides browser
                                enviroment.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="scroller">
                                <h5 class="underlined" style="width: auto; margin-top: 1rem;">What is DOM-based XSS?
                                </h5>
                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">So what do we mean by this? Well these
                                    attacks can change the HTML source code without the need to communicate with the
                                    server. This type of attack is orchestrated on the client-side after the initial
                                    loading of the page. Since the malicious input is stored within the client's browser
                                    environment the attack cannot be detected using traditional methods of analysis. </p>
                                <h5 class="underlined">How can we prevent this type of attack?</h5>
                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Just like the attacks before, the goal
                                    is to get information on you. DOM-based vulnerabilities allow adversaries to
                                    steal/modify legitimate users' data such as cookies or session tokens to access your
                                    sensitive data.</p>
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Some ways to help prevent these attacks are as follows:
                                </p>
                                <ul style="width: fit-content; margin: auto;">
                                    <li>JavaScript Frameworks</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding the use of URI fragments</li>
                                    <li>Use of a content security policy</li>
                                    <li>Automated DOM-based XSS vulnerability scanner</li>
                                    <li>Use of safe APIs</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5 class="underlined" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The importance of preventing DOM-based
                                    attacks</h5>
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While these attacks are solely on the client-side of
                                    websites, the vulnerability starts on the server-side. Therefore, it is important
                                    for developers to take action to try to prevent these attacks as this could be
                                    sensitive customer data leaked to the attacker which in turn could make your company
                                    lose reputation and trust.</p>

                                        taken place over the last few years, one study we wanted to highlight is that of
                                        Google's API hardening technique.</p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">Brief Overview:</h5>
                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem;">Google is a well known tech
                                        company that is widely known for there vast search engine. There are many other
                                        technologies and tasks that happen every single day in the office and one
                                        problem Google tried to tackle was that of XSS attacks. Knowing that people
                                        around the world rely on their product they had to find a way to harden their
                                        cybersecurity force and came up with the idea of creating what they call, API
                                        Harding. </p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">Initial Preparation: </h5>
                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem;">Before pouring tons of money
                                        into the development of this new technique, Google had to take the time to
                                        research past attacks and figure out what made them so vulnerable in the first
                                        place. Over two years of time and research was taken to get enough data on the
                                        topic prior to development.
                                        Google brought to the table in a conference meeting their findings and the new
                                        technique that would be later rolled out to all of their various development
                                        departments.
                                        Starting with <a class="text-primary" title="figureOne-link"
                                            data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#figureOne">Figure 1</a> Google
                                        began breaking down the need for this new technique and tried to bring awareness
                                        to this ever growing threat.</p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">The Design:</h5>
                                    <p>With extensive research done on the topic, Google found that many solutions to
                                        the problem were solved at the later phases of the software development life
                                        cycle. The problem with this approach is when an application gets so big its
                                        hard to stay on top of vulnerabilities as the functionality and complexity grows.
                                        Another key problem these applications face are deadlines on specific aspects of
                                        the developmental cycle. A developer will have to split their time on each part
                                        of the bigger project making it hard for them to spend countless time testing
                                        for bugs or security weakness. Only after an attack has been detected will a
                                        developer have to go back to try to find this crack in the code. In response to
                                        this trend, Googles new approach confronts weakness at the very beginning stages
                                        of web development starting with the compiler.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">API Harding involves three key points in creating <a
                                            class="text-primary" title="safeAPIs-link" data-bs-toggle="modal"
                                            data-bs-target="#safeApis">Safe APIs</a> to help with mitigating potential
                                        XSS threats: Safe Types, Safe Builders, and Safe Sinks.</p>

                                    <h5 class="underlined" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Wide Adoption:</h5>
                                    <p>The last step in the development phase was to test out the new software detection
                                        on a larger scale. Over two years, Google began rolling out this program to all
                                        departments making sure to exempt legacy violations so that existing code could
                                        still compile and run while developers took to this new security enforcement.
                                        They have developed accompanying measures to help with this mitigation to
                                        ensure safe practices and answer any questions they may have. In addition,
                                        Google created a "Bug Hunt" Program that actively takes outside sources to comb
                                        through code to point out any missed security weaknesses to ensure a safer
                                        environment. In most cases the compiler captures API hardening violations and
                                        will try to automatically construct a fix and present it to the developer with
                                        the error message. Developer feedback is also just as important to help improve
                                        the user experience with this new policy and allows for them to bring up any
                                        concerns or problems faced when implemented in their projects. </p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Results:</h5>
                                    <p>With With mandatory compile-time checks now in place, Google launched infrastructure
                                        and data pipelines to monitor the company-wide adoption progress and the results
                                        showed significant improvements  in the way developers handled XSS attacks prior
                                        to deployment.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">Below are a few results on the matter:</p>

                                    <li style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">The above image shows that it is possible to adopt
                                        this new technique while being cost affective. One major part of this adoption
                                        is taking time to manually go through existing code and revise it if a
                                        developer feels as if the APIs are not expressive enough to meet there needs.

                                    <h5 class="underlined">Conclusion: </h5>
                                    <p>With the new technique created and implemented Google has taken a new approach on mitigating XSS attacks by creating API Hardening. Using this new software, developers can now have safe alternatives generated for unsafe sinks. This also takes the approach of catching vulnerabilities at the early stages of the development cycle. Google has taken the liberty to make most of this program open sourced so that others can implement this into their own projects and has brought extensive research to the public for others to review.</p>

                        <p>The code in figure 1 illustrates a web based search application in concept. This example
                            contains a client-side XSS vunerability at line 9, where Javascript code takes in the
                            untrusted users input and renders it to the DOM as HTML markup. </p>
                        <p>The problem with this approach is that there is no way to know what the user will put in here
                            making it possible for attacks! A malicious site can exploit this vulnerability by posting a
                            URL pointing back to the original site and when the user clicks on it, the URL is injected
                            into the search page. Since in this example there is no sanitation or checks on what the
                            user puts in. Perpetrators can insert any content they choose including JavaScript code that
                            can then be executed inside the context of the site the user is on. When this occurs, the
                            capability of the malicious code is no longer restricted by the original security-policy in
                            place and now the infiltrators have unlimited access to the site. What happens next is
                            completely up to them and what they plan to take from the unsuspecting user.</p>

                    <p>With XSS-prone APIs identified and forbidden in the development cycle, Google needed to come up with a set of "Hardened" APIs not known to be vulnerable. In order for a API to be considered "Safe" it has to have met the three critera first:                     </p>

                   <p> There are a total of six safe types to cover a majority of attacks known in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Each safe type corresponds to a type of sink. Values of safe types are immutable once created and are better known as the wrappers of primative strings. The internals of safe types are hidden from developers and in TypeScript, we mark them as private properties. In Javascript, Google implemented additional compile-time checks to forbid any code from accessing these private properties. These properties also prevent safe types from being confuesed with other user-made types.</p>

                   <h5 class="underlined Title" style="font-size: x-large ;" id="safeBuilders">What are Safe Builders?</h5>
                   <p style="padding-bottom: 4rem;">Builders of safe values are essentially the core security checkpoint for the API Hardening technique. Generally, safe values are secure from sensative DOM sinks due to the static checks in place and APIs ensure they can only be created in ways known to be secure. There are a total of four ways to constuct safe values:</p>
                   <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic; ">Build from literal values:</span> These values are hard coded by developers and cannot be manipulated by attackers. These can then be safely converted to safe type. One note to know is that literal values are not inhearently secure, only by making the proper checks and making it secure is it safe.</p>
                   <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build by sanitizing:</span> Google created built in sanitizers to automatically fix untrustworthy strings into safe-to-render HTML markup or safe-to-follow URLs, removing the known XSS vunerability.</p>
                   <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build from template:</span> Building from a template can be seen as a combination of building from constants and  building from sanitizing. The bulk of the template is static while some parts can be configured with run-time values.</p>
                   <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build from manually reviewed sources:</span> If all else fails and none of the previous options listed before suit your need a developer can use this last method to case any value as a safe value. This is a backdoor technique in the safe API design, however they enforce review requirements by making the developer classify them as prohibited XSS sinks and add them to the exemption list.</p>

In hindsight, safe sinks are the hardened version of XSS-prone JavaScript and DOM APIs. Typically, safe sinks are type-safe wrappers of the original APIs. If this sink does not have a safe-type associated with the values given at the time of execution it will be void instead and not run.    </p>
